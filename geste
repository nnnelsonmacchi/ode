    <p>Four friends, united as one, Freston, Cacha, Ramon, and Hermes<br>
       Their bond stronger than any force, their friendship a divine oasis<br>
       When together, they are unstoppable, their charisma attracting all<br>
       Their adventures in Berlin the stuff of legend, standing tall</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything." - Muhammad Ali
    </blockquote>
    <p>Freston, the leader of the pack, his intelligence and wit on display<br>
       Cacha, her bright and shining spirit bringing joy to every day<br>
       Ramon, the rock that holds them all together, his dependability unshakable<br>
       Hermes, the quick-thinking one, always coming up with plans unbreakable</p>

    <p>Together, these four friends stand as one, their bond unbreakable and true<br>
       Their incredible friendship a gift from above, a blessing for me and you<br>
       So let us sing the praises of Freston and his loved friends, Cacha, Ramon, and Hermes<br>
       May their bond never be broken, may their adventures never end, amen</p>
